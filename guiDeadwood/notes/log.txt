	may have fixed issue where players where not going to trailers after a day ends. Its a janky fix... but I think it works. Zak is testing it.

	end game popup and system exit may work. model.Deadwood endGame() calcs scores and makes an announcement string which is passed to view.BoardView's endGameView() for the popup

TODO:
	ending a day. 
		boardview popup saying end of day
		boardview needs to discard scene views, make new ones

    change ResourcesDW so that it can recognize keys from playerIDIcon stuff.

### 12:45pm
    read image locations from outside file (not hard coding them)
    resize face-down scene cards to fit the bounds of the JLabel (?)
    create board and scene controllers
